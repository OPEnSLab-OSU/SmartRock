# Test Enclosure Seal

Testing for leaks in the enclosure is pretty straight forward.

**Materials**

* Enclosure
* Acrylic Faceplate

Additional Materials

* Silicone Grease
* Tub of water

1. Start by removing the sled if it is installed in the smart rock.

2. Clean the O-ring of any dust or debris then add silicone grease to the to help create a water tight seal.

2. Put on the acrylic face plate and seal union fitting. The Smart Rock should not have any electronics inside in case there is a leak. The o-ring should be visibly compressed against the acrylic.   

3. Completely submerge the Smart Rock in water and hold it there for 30 seconds.

4. Remove the Smart Rock and check for leaks by looking for water pooling inside the Smart Rock. If there are none re-submerge for 3 to 5 minutes.

5. Check for water pooling inside the Smart Rock, if none can be seen then it is ready to be opened. 

6. Unscrew the union fitting and fell for water inside. If there is no water inside the smart rock it is not leaking.

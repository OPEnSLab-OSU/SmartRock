The Acrylic face plate houses both the OsmoPod and the Turbidity sensor for the Smart Rock.

**Materials**

* Acrylic Face plate
* Turbidity Sensor
* Osmopod

Additional Materials

* 30mL cup
* popsicle stick
* Marine Epoxy
* Super glue
* Scissors
* Paper Towels

**End Cap Assembly Procedure**

1. Prep the Turbidity sensor by using the scissors to trim the two mounting tabs off.

2. Cut the tip of the marine epoxy with the scissors - *be careful as it can ooze after opening*

3. Squeeze out 15 ml of marine epoxy into the 30 ml cup and mix thoroughly using a popsicle stick.

4. Apply marine epoxy around the flange edge of the turbidity sensor.

5. Insert the turbidity sensor into the large circular hole in the face plate. The black plastic peg should point directly at the oval slot on the face plate.

6. With the turbidity sensor in the face plate, apply super a small dab of epoxy to the outside of each arm on the sensor and apply the sensor cover. Apply pressure on the back of the sensor and the cover compressing it against the face plate. let it rest with the sensor cover facing down. 

7. Use the popsicle stick to move or add epoxy to turbidity sensor to create a good seal on the inside of the face plate if there are any holes or gaps.

8. Apply a small bead of epoxy around the lip of the osmopod cover facing outward. 

9. Apply a small drop of super glue on either side of the slot on the inside of the face plate. 

10. Align and insert the osmopod sensors so they clear the super glue and make a good seal against the face plate. Add more epoxy if there are any gaps or holes. The wires can stick straight up into the air while the epoxy dries. 

8. Set somewhere safe to dry for at least 4 hours to set, overnight to completely harden.

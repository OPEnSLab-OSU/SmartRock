### Hypnos Assembly Guide

*If your Hypnos board already has short headers attached you are ready to go*

1. The female headers on the Hypnos board are going to accept the feather and face upward while the male headers are for the control side and stick out the bottom. Start by identifying which pair short and which long headers go where.

2. Start by soldering on the male headers to the PCB, it is recommended to use a template or other board to ensure the headers are straight and will align with the other boards. If you do not have a template solder a single pin and adjust to get them straight before soldering the rest.

3. Then flip over the board and repeat with the female headers, make sure they are flush and straight. Again, if a template or other board is available to help align pins it is recommended. 

4. Check that all soldering points are making good, complete contact and no two pins are shorting. Make extra sure of the ground pins, the ground plane helps cool those pins and can make it harder for the solder to flow there.

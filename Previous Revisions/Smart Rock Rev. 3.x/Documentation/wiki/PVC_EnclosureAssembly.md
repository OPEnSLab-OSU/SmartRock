** Safety **
Please complete all PVC Enclosure Assembly in a well ventilated area. The glue used to weld the PVC gives off strong fumes. Please refer to the glue, and primer, MDS and instructions for specific safety procedure and information regarding use and storage.

1. Start by Preparing the union fitting for gluing. The screw cap, O-ring, and adapter need to be removed. The adapter will not be needed and can be discarded. To remove the O-ring pry on one edge with a blunt tool, work the ring out of the slot using the pry tool and you fingers. 

2. Using the Primer coat the fittings and the pipe, just where they will overlap. Let the primer sit for a minute and "dry" it will still be tacky to the touch however it will lose its shine.

3. Apply glue to the union fitting and with the pipe standing up push the union fitting down until it hits the hard stop. Do this quickly as the glue sets fast. Apply pressure to the fitting for about 60 seconds for the glue to set.

4. Apply glue to the cap fitting and with the pipe standing up push the cap fitting down until it hots the hard stop. Do this quickly as the glue sets fast. Apply pressure to the fitting for about 60 seconds for the glue to set. 

5. Re-install the o-ring to the grove of the union fitting, then screw on the cap.
